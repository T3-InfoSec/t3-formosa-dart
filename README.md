[Formosa](https://github.com/Yuri-SVB/formosa) is a password format that maximizes the ratio of password strength to user effort.

The password generation process consists of mapping input into meaningful mnemonic sentences, that are, then, condensed into the password.

This is an improvement on the BIP-0039 method — which provides sequences of semantically and syntactically disconnected words as passphrases — because it uses meaningful phrases with a certain theme.
